## Presentation of the Survey Data

We are studying the species repartition and weight of animals caught in plots in our study
area. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxon            | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

If you did not download the data in the previous lesson, we are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file that contains the survey data from Figshare. Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL 
("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169"). This source URL downloads a CSV file from 
figshare. The text after the comma ("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv") is the destination of the 
file on your local machine. You'll need to have a folder on your machine called "data_raw" where 
you'll download the file. So this command downloads a file from Figshare, names it 
"portal_data_joined.csv" and adds it to a preexisting folder named "data_raw".

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

## Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

 **`dplyr`** is a package for making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `length()` or `mean()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. You should already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an "umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when
doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.
2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new
   learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware
   of.

If we haven't already done so, we can type `install.packages("tidyverse")` straight into the console. In fact, it's better to write this in the console than in our script for any package, as there's no need to re-install packages every time we run the script.

Then, to load the package type:
```{r}
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
```

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups - like plots or aquaria. Moving back and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools for this and more sophisticated  data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this
[handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse package **`readr`**.

```{r}
surveys <- read_csv('data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv')
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by each column name and its data type. When you execute `read_csv` on a data file, it looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and guesses the data type for each column as it reads it into R. For example, in this dataset, `read_csv` reads `weight` as `col_double` (a numeric data type), and `species` as `col_character`. You have the option to specify the data type for a column manually by using the `col_types` argument in `read_csv`.

You can inspect the structure of the data:

```{r}
# inspect the data

```

You can also preview the data:

```{r}
# preview the data

```

Notice that the class of the data is a `tbl_df`. This is referred to as a "tibble", the data structure is very similar to a data frame. Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced in the previous lesson. For our purposes the only differences between a tibb;e and a dataframe are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, it
   only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one
   screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.

## Common **`dplyr`** functions

We're now going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarise()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r}
# select columns

```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of the variable to exclude it.

```{r}
# select columns 

```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id` and `species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criterion, use `filter()`:
```{r}
# filter rows

```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r}
# intermediate steps

```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:
```{r}
# nest functions

```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

```{r}
# pipes

```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first through `filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then through `select()` to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter`ed
for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple,
but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:

```{r}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r}
# mutate

```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r}
# mutate

```

If you just want to see the first few rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-**`dplyr`** functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or `magrittr` package is loaded).

```{r}
# head

```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`. The `!` symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where weight *is not* an `NA`.


### Group Challenges

1. Using pipes, subset the `surveys` data to include animals collected before 1995 and retain only the columns `year`, `sex`, and `weight`.

```{r}
## Challenge 1

```

2. Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the following criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a new column called `hindfoot_cm` containing the `hindfoot_length` values converted to centimeters. In this `hindfoot_cm` column, there are no `NA`s and all values are less than 3.

**Hint**: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

```{r}
## Challenge 2

```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarise()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.


#### The `summarise()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarise()`, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r}
# group_by

```

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  tail()
```

Here, we used `tail()` to look at the last six rows of our summary. Before, we had used `head()` to look at the first six rows. We can see that the `sex` column contains `NA` values because some animals had escaped before their sex and body weights could be determined. The resulting `mean_weight` column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which refers to "Not a Number") because `mean()` was called on a vector of `NA` values while at the same time setting `na.rm = TRUE`. To avoid this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we attempt to calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing values are removed first, we can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

```{r}
# group_by

```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarise multiple variables at the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r}
# group_by

```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter species first:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))

```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

```{r}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) 
```


#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```{r}
# counting

```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is equivalent to:  

```{r}
# counting

```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:  

```{r}
# counting

```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). 

If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r}
# counting

```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. 

For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:

```{r}
# counting

```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75 observations of the *albigula* species that are not specified for its sex (i.e. `NA`).


## Group Challenges
1. How many animals were caught in each `plot_type` surveyed?

```{r}
## Challenge 1

```

2. Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species (using `species_id`). Also add the number of observations (hint: see `?n`).

```{r}
## Challenge 2


```

3. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`, `genus`, `species_id`, and `weight`.

```{r}
## Challenge 3


```

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from or summarise your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data`, in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good practice to keep them separate. The `data_raw` folder should only contain the raw, unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare a cleaned up version of the data set that doesn't include any missing data.

We will start by removing observations of animals for which `weight` and `hindfoot_length` are missing, or the `sex` has not been determined.

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have changed through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare species (i.e., that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do this in two steps: first we are going to create a data set that counts how often each species has been observed, and filter out the rare species; then, we will extract only the observations for these more common species:

```{r}
### Create the dataset for exporting:
##  Start by removing observations for which the `species_id`, `weight`,
##  `hindfoot_length`, or `sex` data are missing:
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(species_id != "",        # remove missing species_id
         !is.na(weight),                 # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),        # remove missing hindfoot_length
         sex != "")                      # remove missing sex

##  Now remove rare species in two steps. First, make a list of species which appear at least 50 times in our dataset:
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
  count(species_id) %>% 
  filter(n >= 50) %>%
  select(species_id)

##  Second, keep only those species:
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same data set, check that `surveys_complete` has 30463 rows and 13 columns by typing `dim(surveys_complete)`.

```{r}
# check data

```

Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our `data` folder.

```{r}
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data/surveys_complete.csv")
```

```{r}
if (!dir.exists("data")) dir.create("data")
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data/surveys_complete.csv")
```


### Pivoting with `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

There are three rules defining a "Tidy" dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column.
2. Each observation has its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

In `surveys`, the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables associated with each record, e.g., the weight or sex of each animal. What if instead of comparing records, we wanted to compare the different mean weight of each genus between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We'd need to create a new table where each row is comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values in `genus` would become the names of columns and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is then straightforward to explore the relationship between the weight of different genera within, and between, the plots. The key point here is that we have **pivoted** the data according to the observations of interest: average genus weight per plot instead of recordings per date.

The inverse procedure would be to pivot column names into values of a variable.

We can do both these of operations with two `tidyr` functions, namely `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`.

#### Wider

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data 
2. *names_from*: the column whose values will become new column names.  
3. *values_from*: the column whose values will fill the new columns.

Further arguments include `fill` which if set fills in missing values with the specified value.

Let's use `pivot_wider()` to transform `surveys` to find the mean weight of each genus in each plot over the entire survey period. 

We first use `filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` to filter our observations and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the `mean_weight`.

```{r}
# pivot_wider

```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread across multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. 

Using `pivot_wider()` to key on `genus` with values from `mean_weight` this becomes 24 observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot.

```{r}
# pivot_wider

```


We could now plot comparisons between the weight of genera in different plots, although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

```{r}
# pivot_wider

```

#### Longer

The converse situation could occur if we had been provided with data in then form of `surveys_wide`, where the genus names are column names, but we wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values in a new column, and the other variable contains the values previously found across all the original columns.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. *cols*: the columns that we want to pivot into longer format.
3. *names_to*: the name of the new column for storing what were previously column names.
4. *values_to*: the name of another new column for storing the values that were in previously found in the *cols*.

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_wide` we would create a new column called `genus` and another called `mean_weight` and use all columns except `plot_id` for the key variable. Here we exclude `plot_id` from being `pivoted_longer()`.

```{r}
# pivot_longer

```

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the pivoted format.

Pivoting wider and then longer can be a useful way to balance out a dataset so that every replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it's easier to specify what to pivot than what to leave alone. And if the columns are directly adjacent, we don't even need to list them all out - just use the `:` operator!

```{r}
# pivot_longer

```

## Challenges 

1. Pivot the `surveys` data frame with `year` as columns, `plot_id` as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarise before pivoting, and use the function `n_distinct()` to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. It's a powerful function! See `?n_distinct` for more.

```{r}
## Challenge 1

```

2. Now take that data frame and `pivot_longer()` it back so each row is a unique `plot_id` by `year` combination.

```{r}
## Challenge 2

```


3. The `surveys` data set has two measurement columns: `hindfoot_length` and `weight`. This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each measurement per year in different plot types. Let's walk through a common solution for this type of problem. First, use `pivot_longer()` to create a dataset where we have a key column called `measurement` and a `value` column that takes on the value of either `hindfoot_length` or  `weight`. *Hint*: You'll need to specify which columns are being gathered.

```{r}
## Challenge 3

```


4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each `measurement` in each `year` for each different `plot_type`. Then `pivot_wider()` them into a data set with a column for `hindfoot_length` and `weight`. *Hint*: You only need to specify the key and value columns for `pivot_wider()`.

```{r}
## Challenge 4

```
